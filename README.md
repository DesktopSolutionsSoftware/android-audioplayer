com.kcwdev.audio
===========================================

Exposes `android.media.MediaPlayer` to Titanium for developing advanced media players.

This is an extended version of [com.kcwdev.audio](https://github.com/kcwdevllc/android-audioplayer). It adds the ability to toggle routing of audio through the phone's main speaker and ear speaker.

Contributing 
============
Bug reports, pull requests, and even just notes that the module works on your device are greatly helpful and appreciated.

The APIs to develop this speaker toggle have changed throughout versions of Android and documentation throughout the internet is highly inconsistent as a result. Knowing whether or not this works on your particular device and OS version is a huge help.
