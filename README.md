This project is no longer under active development but pull requests are welcomed and will be reviewed!

Note: This module was not built with and therefore currently is not compatible with TiSDK 6.1.0 on Android.

com.kcwdev.audio
===========================================

Exposes `android.media.MediaPlayer` to Titanium for developing advanced media players.

This is an extended version of [com.kcwdev.audio](https://github.com/kcwdevllc/android-audioplayer). It adds the ability to toggle routing of audio through the phone's main speaker and ear speaker.

Contributing 
============
Bug reports, pull requests, and even just notes that the module works on your device are greatly helpful and appreciated.

The APIs to develop this speaker toggle have changed throughout versions of Android and documentation throughout the internet is highly inconsistent as a result. Knowing whether or not this works on your particular device and OS version is a huge help.

Downloading
============
Download tagged releases if you're planning to use this in your project. Master branch may contain untested revisions.
